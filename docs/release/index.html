    <h1>Check back another time for some docs</h1>
    <p>An older version of the compiler was used to build the documentation.</p>
    <p>
        But since the refactor and generalization of the build system, everything has been redesigned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the build system is ready to generate static sites again, the docs will be back up and running again.
