## JS backend and HTML builder hardening pass

### PR - JS backend semantic audit for Alpha surface

Verify that the JS backend behavior matches the intended Alpha language rules for the supported feature set.

**Checklist**
- Audit runtime helpers involved in aliasing, copying, arrays, result propagation, casts, and builtin helpers.
- Add or expand integration tests where behavior depends on emitted JS runtime logic.
- Fix any semantics that are currently “working by accident”.
- Re-check collection builtin lowering in `src/compiler_frontend/ast/field_access/collection_builtin.rs` and remove any compatibility-only branches that drift from current frontend semantics.
- Confirm builtins using synthetic/fake parameter declarations are either removed or intentionally retained with clear justification
- Add backend-facing tests for:
  - collection get/set/push/remove/length
  - error helper builtin methods
  - mutable receiver method place validation

**Done when**
- The JS backend is trustworthy enough for real Alpha examples.

### PR - HTML builder final stabilization pass

Treat the HTML project builder as a real Alpha product surface.

**Checklist**
- Re-audit route derivation, homepage rules, duplicate path diagnostics, tracked assets, cleanup, and output layout.
- Add any remaining config and artifact assertions needed for confidence.
- Ensure docs site and small static-site projects remain a valid proving ground.

**Done when**
- The HTML project builder can be presented as a stable Alpha capability.
