# Choices (enums)
Choices are a way to define a set of possible values. They are similar to enums in Rust (tagged unions).

Choices use a double colon for their declaration.

You access one of the choices using double colon also.

[Code:
    Some_Options Choice:
        Option1 String,
        Option2 String,
    ;

    option = Choice::Option2
