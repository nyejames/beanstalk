## If Statements
If statements can be used as expressions or statements.
They can also be used for pattern matching, all with a similar syntax.

[Code:
    v = 1
    if v is not 1:
        print("nope")
    else
        print("yep")
    zz

    -- If as an expression
    x = 0
    msg = if x is:
        0: "nope"
        else: "defintely nope"
    zz

    print(msg) -- prints "defintely nope"
]

# Pattern matching
[code:
    -- Pattern matching
    -- Must be exhaustive
    thing = 69
    match thing:
        0: print("zero")
        < 0: print("negative")
        > 1: print("big number")
        else: print("only one")
    zz

# Loops
Only 1 keyword for loops "for". 

Using the "in" keyword, you can specify an integer, float or collection to iterate through or define a new integer, float or collection. 

[code:
    for thing in things:
        print(thing)
    zz

    for c in collection_of_choices:
        if c is cool: 
            print(cool.value)
        else: 
            print(cool.value)
        zz
    zz

    for -20 to big_number:
        print("hello")
    zz

    -- reverse loop
    for n in big_number to smaller_number:
        print(n)
    zz

    for item in collection:
        print(item.index)
    zz

    -- Using a loop in a scene
    names = {"Priya", "Sam", "Chad"}
    [main:
        [for name in names:
            Name: [name]
        ]
    ]

    -- scene looks like:
    -- Name: Priya
    -- Name: Sam
    -- Name: Chad
