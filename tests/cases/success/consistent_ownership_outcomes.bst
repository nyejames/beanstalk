-- Test case: Consistent ownership outcomes across all paths
-- This should be accepted by Beanstalk's global consistency requirement

-- This test demonstrates correct usage where the same place has
-- consistent ownership outcomes regardless of control flow path

data = "test_data"
condition = true

if condition:
    -- On this path, data is moved (last use)
    result1 ~= data
    io(result1)
    -- No further use of data
else
    -- On this path, data is also moved (last use)
    result2 ~= data
    io(result2)
    -- No further use of data
;

-- This is correct because:
-- 1. In both branches, data is moved (it's the last use in both cases)
-- 2. The ownership outcome is consistent across all paths
-- 3. This satisfies Beanstalk's global consistency requirement
