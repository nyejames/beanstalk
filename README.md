  <h1>Beanstalk üå±</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>A simple, safe, statically typed programming language for building WebAssembly modules and web apps.</strong>
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>‚ö†Ô∏è This is currently a work in progress compiler. See CONTRIBUTING.md if you're inspired to help out!</p>

  <h2>Current Progress</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend</strong> - Core syntax implemented. Currently refactoring header parsing before AST for full dependency resolution</li>
    <li><strong>Type Checking</strong> - Basics complete, full struct type checking todo</li>
    <li><strong>Mid Level Optimisation</strong> - Fast Constant folding in place, more powerful optimisation passes to be added in the IR</li>
    <li><strong>IR / Codegen</strong>Basics functioning - Will become the focus when the frontend is stabilised. </li>
    <li><strong>Borrow Checker</strong> - Not working yet, In progress. </li>
    <li><strong>Build system</strong> - Basics in place, some scaffolding for dealing with different types of projects. Wasm JIT support via Wasmer is the focus.
    </li>

# Overview / Goals
Beanstalk is statically typed, procedural and has a borrow checker. It compiles to Wasm and aims to provide all the glue code, runtimes and scaffolding for your Wasm project with the build system.

The goal is to also be lightweight, purpose built Wasm language. This means each project will be specifically tailored to producing all the files and glue code you need for creating an app or web page. 

**Design Goals**
- Minimal, clean syntax with very powerful string templates that are perfect for generating text content / HTML / typesetting or other tree based string structures.
- Simple, strong, static type system
- Batteries-included with as much tooling as possible integrated directly in the compiler and standard library
- Fast development compile times to support easy hot-reloading and fast iteration, aiming to compete with interpreted/JIT languages while still being AOT compiled and optimisable for production builds
- Backend designed around only producing high-quality Wasm efficiently and integrating with that ecosystem
- Secure and fast. No 'unsafe' but with simpler move semantics and lifetimes than Rust
- Uses a borrow checker with a simpler ownership model than Rust to trade some raw performance for consistency and ease of use
