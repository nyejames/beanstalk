# Overview / Goals
Beanstalk is a statically typed language that compiles to Wasm and aims to generate glue code for that Wasm.

The whole language is built around an extremely clean template syntax.

The goal is to also be a more general lightweight Wasm-focused language. 
The language aims to be great for building a website, making config files or as a lightweight embedded or UI language for apps and games.

**Design Goals**
- Minimal syntax with very powerful string templates for generating text content / typesetting and styling or configs
- Simple, static type system
- Comes batteries-included with as much tooling as possible integrated directly in the compiler
- Fast compile times to support hot reloading
- No LLVM backend, no preferred Wasm runtime targets
- Borrow checker with no 'unsafe' and much simpler move semantics / lifetimes than Rust

### Compiled Output
The compiler aims to optimise specifically for Wasm, and create small and efficient modules. No 100kb Wasm files to just print "hello world".

Being compiled means folding constants, type checking and optimising is all done for you.
But the priority is to compile fast and small modules rather than highly optimised ones.

The compiler itself is written in Rust, and uses as few dependencies as possible to keep it fast and reliable.
