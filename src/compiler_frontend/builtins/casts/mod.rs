//! Builtin cast surface: target classification, evidence table, and policy helpers.
//!
//! WHAT: groups the cast-related modules that together own the compiler-supported
//!      builtin cast surface. The module map is small and re-export based:
//!      - `targets`  — classification enums, policy ids, and target/resolution helpers
//!      - `evidence` — single static table of initial builtin evidence rows
//!      - `policies` — pure policy functions that operate on `BuiltinCastLiteral`
//!      - `traits`   — central names and registration helpers for core cast traits
//!      - `resolution` — AST cast resolver wiring
//!      - `numeric_limits` — Alpha signed i32 cast range shared by folding and runtime
//! WHY: the cast owner needs one clearly mapped location that parser, AST, and
//!      folding stages can all reach for cast answers without depending on
//!      parser orchestration modules or backend code.
