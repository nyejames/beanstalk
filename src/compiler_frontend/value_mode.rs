//! Frontend value/access classification.

//! WHAT: carries AST-level mutability/reference/owned-vs-borrowed classification for expressions,
//! declarations, and binding targets.
//!
//! WHY: semantic type identity must not carry access or ownership state. `ValueMode` keeps this
//! data attached to values/bindings while `DataType` remains a pure type description.
//!
//! This is not the final runtime ownership flag model. Runtime ownership remains a later lowering
//! concern driven by borrow/last-use analysis.
