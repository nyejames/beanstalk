//! Frontend style-directive registry used by tokenization and template parsing.
//!
//! WHAT:
//! - `specs` defines the directive contract shared by core language directives and
//!   handler-based formatter directives.
//! - `compatibility` keeps template-head compatibility tags and policies out of parser
//!   branches.
//! - `builtins` owns frontend-provided directive data in stable diagnostic order.
//! - `registry` merges frontend and project-builder directives for tokenizer/AST lookup.
//!
//! WHY:
//! - The frontend must know the directive set before backend lowering.
//! - Project builders can register project-specific directives without changing parser code.
//! - A single merged registry avoids tokenizer/AST drift and keeps diagnostics consistent.
//!
//! Directive ownership policy:
//! - Frontend built-ins define language/template semantics and generic formatter directives
//!   such as `$markdown`.
//! - Project builders may only register additional project-owned directives such as the HTML
//!   project's `$html`, `$css`, and `$escape_html`.
//! - The frontend always executes directive handlers during parsing/folding, regardless of
//!   whether the directive itself is frontend-owned or project-owned.
