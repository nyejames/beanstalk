//! Runtime slot planning data shapes.
//!
//! WHAT: Defines the small planner-local shapes used while runtime slot
//! applications are materialized into the module-scoped TIR store.
//!
//! WHY: HIR consumes the neutral owned handoff produced from TIR. The runtime
//! slot planner still needs stable source/site IDs while routing, but it no
//! longer builds a separate render-plan handoff that later has to be converted
//! back into TIR.
