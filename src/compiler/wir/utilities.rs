//! # WIR Utilities Module
//!
//! This module contains utility functions and helper types used throughout
//! the WIR transformation process.
//!
//! Note: This module is currently empty as all utility functions have been
//! consolidated into the expressions.rs module where they are actually used.
//! This file is kept for future utility functions that may be needed across
//! multiple WIR modules.
