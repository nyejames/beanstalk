/// WASM Intermediate Representation structure with simplified borrow checking
///
/// This WIR is designed specifically for efficient WASM generation with
/// simple dataflow-based borrow checking using program points and events.
///
/// ## Design Principles
///
/// ### Simplicity Over Sophistication
/// - Simple events instead of complex Polonius facts
/// - One program point per statement for clear tracking
/// - Standard dataflow algorithms instead of constraint solving
/// - WASM-first design avoiding unnecessary generality
///
/// ### Performance Focus
/// - Efficient bitsets for loan tracking
/// - Worklist algorithm optimized for WASM control flow
/// - Fast compilation prioritized over analysis sophistication
/// - Memory-efficient data structures
///
/// ### Maintainability
/// - Clear program point model for easy debugging
/// - Standard algorithms that are well-understood
/// - Simple data structures that are easy to extend
/// - Comprehensive test coverage for reliability
///
/// ## Core Data Structures
///
/// - `ProgramPoint`: Sequential identifiers for each WIR statement
/// - `Events`: Simple event records per program point for dataflow analysis
/// - `Loan`: Simplified borrow tracking with origin points
/// - `Place`: WASM-optimized memory location abstractions (unchanged)
///
/// See `docs/dataflow-analysis-guide.md` for detailed algorithm documentation.
