# Test Failure Analysis Report

## Summary
Out of 27 tests:
- **6 successful compilations** (22.2%)
- **13 failed compilations** (48.1%)
- **7 expected failures** (25.9%)
- **1 unexpected success** (3.7%)

**Overall: 48.1% of tests behaved as expected**

## Categories of Failures

### 1. Variable Reference Issues (Most Common)
**Error Pattern**: "Variable reference 'X' produced non-use rvalue, which is not supported in operand context"

**Affected Tests**:
- `beanstalk_scope_semantics.bst` - variable 'condition'
- `borrow_checker_basic_variables.bst` - variable 'counter'
- `basic_mutations_1.bst` - variable 'counter'
- `basic_arithmetic.bst` - variable 'base'
- `basic_mutations_2.bst` - variable 'counter'
- `wasix_print_variables.bst` - variable 'message'
- `disjoint_field_borrows.bst` - variable 'x_ref'
- `simple_if_test.bst` - variable 'condition'
- `basic_features.bst` - variable 'int_var'

**Root Cause**: The WIR transformation is not properly handling variable references. When variables are used in expressions, they should generate `Rvalue::Use(Operand::Copy(place))` or `Rvalue::Use(Operand::Move(place))`, but instead they're generating some other type of rvalue that can't be converted to operands.

**Implementation Gap**: The AST-to-WIR transformation in `build_wir.rs` needs to properly handle variable references and generate appropriate `Use` rvalues.

### 2. Legacy Runtime Expression Issues
**Error Pattern**: "Legacy runtime expression transformation called at line X, column Y. Complex runtime expressions require enhanced processing with temporary variable support."

**Affected Tests**:
- `dynamic_if_test.bst` - line 8, column 6
- `beanstalk_complete_integration.bst` - line 14, column 20

**Root Cause**: The compiler is encountering complex runtime expressions that require temporary variables, but the current implementation falls back to a legacy transformation that's not fully implemented.

**Implementation Gap**: Enhanced runtime expression processing with temporary variable support needs to be implemented in the WIR transformation.

### 3. Function Call Syntax Issues
**Error Pattern**: "Invalid operator: Token { kind: CloseParenthesis, location: ... } after variable: X"

**Affected Tests**:
- `borrow_checker_function_calls.bst` - line 21, function call `simple_function(number)`

**Root Cause**: The parser is not properly handling function call syntax. The closing parenthesis is being treated as an invalid operator.

**Implementation Gap**: Function call parsing needs to be fixed in the expression parser.

### 4. WASM Type Mismatch Issues
**Error Pattern**: "WASM type error: type mismatch: expected i32, found f64"

**Affected Tests**:
- `basic_declarations.bst` - WASM offset: 0x68

**Root Cause**: Type inconsistency in WASM generation. The compiler is generating WASM code with mismatched types, likely due to incorrect type mapping from Beanstalk types to WASM types.

**Implementation Gap**: Type mapping and WASM code generation needs to be fixed to ensure consistent types.

### 5. Unexpected Success (Should Fail)
**Test**: `immutable_mutation_attempt.bst`

**Issue**: This test attempts to mutate an immutable variable, which should fail, but it's currently succeeding.

**Root Cause**: The compiler is not properly enforcing immutability rules.

**Implementation Gap**: Immutability checking needs to be implemented or fixed.

## Working Tests Analysis

### Successfully Passing Tests:
1. **`wasix_print_multiple.bst`** - Simple print statements work
2. **`wasix_print_special_chars.bst`** - String literals with escape sequences work
3. **`borrow_checker_string_memory.bst`** - Basic string handling and borrow checking works
4. **`beanstalk_implicit_borrowing.bst`** - Borrow checker is working for basic cases
5. **`last_use_precision.bst`** - Borrow checker last-use analysis works
6. **`declarations_only.bst`** - Variable declarations work when no mutations are involved

### Key Observations:
- **String literals work**: Tests with simple string literals and print statements pass
- **Borrow checker works**: The borrow checking implementation is functional for basic cases
- **Variable declarations work**: Basic variable declarations without complex expressions work
- **Template strings work**: The `[:content]` syntax for mutable strings works

## String Syntax Analysis

### Current Working String Syntax:
- `"Hello, world!"` - String slices (immutable) ✅
- `[:content]` - Mutable template strings ✅
- `print("message")` - String literals in function calls ✅

### No Syntax Issues Found:
The string syntax appears to be correctly implemented. The failing tests are not due to outdated string syntax but rather due to variable reference and expression handling issues.

## Function Return Syntax Analysis

### Current Function Syntax in Tests:
```beanstalk
simple_function |value ~Int| -> Int:
    result = value + 1
    return result
;
```

### Issues Found:
- Function calls like `simple_function(number)` are failing due to parser issues
- Function definitions appear to be parsed correctly
- The issue is in function call parsing, not function definition syntax

## Struct Usage Analysis

### No Struct Usage Found:
None of the current test files use struct syntax, so there are no struct-related test failures to analyze.

## Priority Implementation Order

### High Priority (Blocking Most Tests):
1. **Fix variable reference handling in WIR transformation** - Affects 9 tests
2. **Fix function call parsing** - Affects function-related tests
3. **Implement enhanced runtime expression processing** - Affects 2 tests

### Medium Priority:
4. **Fix WASM type mapping consistency** - Affects 1 test
5. **Implement immutability enforcement** - Affects 1 test (should fail but passes)

### Low Priority:
6. **Add struct support tests** - No current tests use structs
7. **Update string syntax** - Current syntax appears to be working correctly

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on WIR transformation fixes first** - This will resolve the majority of failing tests
2. **Function call parsing needs immediate attention** - Critical for basic language functionality
3. **String syntax is not the issue** - The current string implementation appears to be working
4. **Borrow checker is working well** - The borrow checking implementation is solid
5. **Need to add comprehensive struct tests** - Once basic functionality is fixed
